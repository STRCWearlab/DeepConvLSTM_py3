# DeepConvLSTM_py3
DeepConvLSTM implemented in python 3 and pytorch

Included is an implementation of DeepConvLSTM in python 3 and torch, along with a jupyter notebook giving an example of training and testing the model on the Opportunity challenge dataset.


### Opportunity example notebook
To interact with the notebook, you will need to install the requirements indicated in the requirements.txt file included in the repository. You will also need python >= 3.6.2. Once that is done, run 

```
jupyter notebook opportunity_example.ipynb
```

### Main script

After installing all dependencies in the requirements.txt file you will be able to run the main DeepConvLSTM_py3.py script. Use

```
python3 DeepConvLSTM_py3.py -h
```

for a list of command line options.
